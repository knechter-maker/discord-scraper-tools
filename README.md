## About The Project

![Screen Shot](pictures/exam.PNG)

The "Discord Server User Collector" is a Python script built using the Discord.py library, designed to help server administrators easily collect a list of users and their IDs from a specific Discord server. This project can be particularly useful for server management, data analysis, or user tracking purposes.

User Data Collection: The script connects to a Discord server using a bot account and gathers information about all the users within the specified server.

User-Friendly Setup: The project utilizes a configuration file (config.json) to store the bot token, making it easy for users to set up and run the script with minimal effort.

Customization: The script allows you to specify the target server by providing its server ID as a command-line argument, making it flexible and adaptable for different server contexts.

Data Export: The collected user data is saved in a JSON file (server_users.json) in a structured format, which can be easily accessed and analyzed as needed.
